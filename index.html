        <p>The Teltonika FMC230 is water and dust resistant tracker with 4G (LTE Cat 1) network coverage including 2G (GSM) fallback compatibility. It comes equipped with internal GNSS, LTE antennas, configurable digital/analog/negative and impulse inputs, three DOUT outputs, Bluetooth connectivity, and backup battery.

            This tracker is dust tight and protected against the effects of a temporary immersion in water. It can be mounted inside and outside of a vehicle without worries that high pressured water, mud or a dusty environment will impact its operation or performance quality. This is particularly relevant for the industries where harsh conditions exist, such as agriculture, construction and mining, and more.
            
            For starters, FMC230 features negative input which allows you to save precious integration time while connecting accessories like vehicle doors sensor, alarm buttons, seatbelt detection, and other similar sensors or accessories.
            
            In addition to that, the device has an integrated possibility to enable Impulse Input for precise fuel flow meter data reading. Impulse based fuel usage monitoring is much more accurate than a different type of fuel metering sensors, and it makes the FMC230 a perfect solution for high fuel usage machines like cranes, construction vehicles, mining machines, agriculture equipment.</p>

        <p>To insert the Micro-SIM card and connect the battery, follow these steps: 1. Upon receiving your device, note that it is partly closed. 2. Carefully remove the top and bottom covers of the device. 3. Insert the Micro-SIM card as shown, ensuring that the PIN request is disabled or refer to the Teltonika Configurator Wiki for instructions on how to enter it later. Ensure that the cut-off corner of the Micro-SIM card is pointing outward from the slot. 4. Connect the battery to the device according to the provided diagram. Place the battery in a position where it doesn't obstruct other components. 5. Once the configuration is complete, refer to the "PC Connection (Windows)" section and attach the top and bottom covers of the device, pressing them twice to ensure full closure. 6. Verify that the product casing is closed correctly. It is important to note that this device has an IP67 casing with a two-phase closing mechanism, ensuring reliable protection and ease of use. Please ensure that the product casing corner clips are securely fixed and that the cable is connected to maintain the IP67 protection level. </p>

            <h4 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Final recommendations:</h4>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
              When connecting wires, it is important to follow these guidelines: Ensure that the module is not plugged in while connecting the wires. Fasten the wires to stable and non-moving parts, keeping them away from heat-emitting or moving objects. Avoid exposed wires, and if the factory isolation is removed during the connection process, apply isolation material. If the wires are located in exterior or vulnerable areas exposed to heat, humidity, dirt, etc., provide additional isolation and ensure they are not loose. Do not connect wires to board computers or control units. When connecting the power source, be aware that power may still be available on the power wires even after the car computer goes into sleep mode, so measure the voltage again after connecting the module. It is recommended to connect to the main power cable in the fuse box and use a 3A, 125V external fuse. When connecting the ignition wire, verify that it is a genuine ignition wire that maintains power after starting the engine, and not an ACC wire. Confirm that power is still available when turning off any vehicle devices. Connect the ignition to the ignition relay output or choose an alternative relay with power output when the ignition is on. For the ground wire, connect it to the vehicle frame or fixed metal parts. If the wire is fixed with a bolt, ensure the loop is connected to the end of the wire. For better contact, remove paint from the spot where the loop will be connected.</p>
